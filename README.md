swAPP

declutter your house and free yourself by joining the community of like-minded people!
ecology is the new hot trend and with that in mind i've decided to create an app that is gonna teach
people about ecology and also offer a platform for exchanging stuff that is no longer needed in your household.
you've got a piece of furniture that is no longer serving you but is still in a good shape ?
create a profile on swAPP and add it. maybe your neighbour could make a use out of it ?
or if it's completely broken read our ecology guide and learn how to dispose it with the least impact on the environment

**we teach about good practices
we preach circular economy approach
we offer a great community of eco-aware people who share the same goal: SUSTAINABILITY**

key features:

- login and register page
- single user can:
  -> interact with the other users, chat, **community page coming soon**
  -> add pieces of clothing, household items etc. that are used or new in a GOOD CONDITION, that he no longer needs and wants to give back to someone who still can make us of it,
  -> select items that he's interested in
  -> adopt the products
